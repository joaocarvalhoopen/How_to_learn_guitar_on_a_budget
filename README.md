# How to learn guitar on a budget
A guide to the adventurer

## Description

I'm an engineer and exact sciences kind of person, but I strongly believe that everyone should strive to have a well-rounded knowledge and education of the more artistic side of things. I would not like to call them creative side of things because work in sciences can also be very creative, although normally people don't talk in this terms, but experience taught me that. <br>
Be it in prose or poetry, be it in drawing or in painting, be it in design, in crafts or in music, always thrive to express your artistic self.<br>
<br>
Although I'm very intrigued by the following 3 books and maybe latter I will follow their path, because normally I'm a very book oriented person. <br>
<br>
**Books:**

* The Bible of Classical Guitar Technique <br>
  by Hubert Kappel

* Pumping Nylon: The Classical Guitarist's Technique Handbook <br>
  by Scott Tennant

* Guitar Aerobics: A 52-Week, One-lick-per-day Workout Program for Developing, Improving and Maintaining Guitar Technique <br>
  by Troy Nelson

But currently I have chosen to learn guitar from the free content path on the internet, more precisely currently Electric Guitar. This choice is based on the current moment that we all leave, beginning of the second Covid19 wave in Europe, and the clear feeling that things economically are and will be getting tougher all around the world.


## How to tune your guitar

Use a tuner or a tuner APP and tune to the following mnemonic notes for each string. <br>
<br>
**E**ddie - Higher string position <br>
**A**te      <br>
**D**ynamite <br>
**G**ood     <br>
**B**ye      <br>
**E**ddie - Lower position string <br>
<br>
Higher position string ____ **E** - **A** - **D** - **G** - **B** - **E** ____ Lower position string

## In my case after much searching for quality but on cheap guitars, this was the brand I have chosen
Harley Benton, they currently start at 73 euros for an adult’s guitar. I leave in Europe so shipping is low. They have a lot of variety of models, they are made in China or Indonesia but the quality control is made in Germany by Thomann. I have read about the experiences of others with this brand and it was good so I decided to choose it and I'm pleased with it.

## Low budget multi-pedal effects, guitar amp and cabinet simulator, echo and reverb and noise gate

I don't have it yet but my choice is the cheap with good sound quality ZOOM G1 Four with phones so the neighbors don't complain.
This also has a tuner in it.
You will also need a cable and some picks.

## Future programming and electronics projects for guitar
I have many projects in my github around the audio subject. Guitar is a really fertile space for ideas in DIY electronics projects and DSP programming projects. Probably I will be inspired to do some specific to guitar in the future.
